Binary Classification using FTRL based on FM and LR
Logistic regression model is a binary classification model. It is widely used in many applications and obtains
good results in both the implement performance and time consumptions. This model is very simple but effective especially
in large-scale data settings and adored by many industrial experts.

From a deep understanding, logistic regression model is the simplest neural network unit, which is very popular in the
current deep learning community. Because of the simplicity, the logistic regression model can be implemented very efficiently.

Factorization machine is a enhanced binary classification model. Different from the traditional classifier, it can explore
the second-order feature dependencies-the feature intersection. Compared with the logistic regression model, the additional
term is the intersected feature term for the potential relations, that can be taken as a map in the hidden layer of neural network.
